  * To predict the power consumption of a house based on the features such as Temperature,Humidity,Pressure etc. 
  * We have done the normal EDA process for the messed up data and we have applied regression algorithm to estimate the power cosumption so that we could reduce the power usage for particular appliance.
  * To get the better understanding for the required data we have used vizualization plot like KDE(Kernel Density Estimation) , Histogram and feature selection for the regressions.

<B>Flight Delay Analysis:</B>
   * To predict the estimation delay of the flight using the previous Data.
   * We split the data into test and train models and then used regression algorithms with apache spark to get the prediction of the data and done vizualization according to the requirement of the flights.
